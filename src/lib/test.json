When the pizza dough reaches the sides of thepan, press it up to form a lip along the inside of the pan. When the pizzacrust reaches about 1-1 ½ inches high along the sides of the pan, press withyour thumbs or fingertips to seal the pizza crust to the sides of the pan. Nowthe dough should stick to the pan and you can add the rest of theingredients.\nAfter the dough comes the cheese. Lay slices of cheese directly on top ofthe pizza dough in 2-3 layers. It may seem like too much cheese at first, butChicago-style deep dish pizza is nothing if not heavy on the mozzarella.Once the cheese slices are layered on, add the sausage or pepperoni.\nFor a sausage pizza, place little chunks of uncooked Italian sausage all overthe top of the cheese and press down on the sausage to form a web. Thiswill basically be a solid layer of sausage, but it’s best if there are somesausage-free spots here and there where the cheese can bubble up throughthe sausage and come into contact with the tomato sauce. This will improvethe flavor of the pizza overall, in my opinion.\nFor a pepperoni pizza, add the suggested number of pepperoni on top of thecheese layer, overlapping each pepperoni slightly. This should evenly coverthe cheese in one thin layer.\nNow that the sausage layer is finished, add the crushed tomato sauce on topof the sausage layer. Ladle the chunky tomato sauce into the center of thepizza and then spread it out to the edge of the pizza with your fingertips intrue Chicago-pizzeria-fashion (or just spread the sauce out to the edges witha ladle if that bothers you, no one will know the difference). You want to spread the sauce out in an even layer from the center to the edge, and thesauce should just barely meet the crust. This will ideally allow a little bit ofcheese to bubble up to the surface while the pizza is baking and caramelizealong the interior of the crust.\nFor the finishing touch, sprinkle half of the total amount of grated parmesancheese on top of the tomato sauce. You’ll add the remaining parmesan tothe top of the pizza when the pizza is done baking.",

This will allow thecheese to harden a little bit and the pizza will be easier to remove from thepan.\nAfter the five minute rest, carefully remove the pizza from the pan, lifting itfrom the edges with one or two spatulas. Transfer the pizza onto a woodencutting board to serve and sprinkle the top of the pizza with the remaininggrated parmesan cheese.\nCut the pizza into 6-8 slices with a pizza cutter, depending on how big youwant the slices to be. I usually cut the pizza into six equal slices for a 9” or10” pan, and into eight equal slices for a 12” pan.\nEnjoy a wonderful slice of this sourdough deep dish pizza as is, with a dashof red pepper flakes, or with my favorite condiment: a spoonful of Chicago-style giardiniera.",
